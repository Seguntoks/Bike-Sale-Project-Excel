# ABOUT DATASET

The bike sales dataset was sourced from Alex Freberg, host of Alex The Analyst Bootcamp. However, the project was an individual project, and I personally explored the dataset using Microsoft Excel tool and displayed my creativity. 

# DATA CLEANING AND TRANSFORMATION

The dataset from the Bike_Buyers Sheet was replicated into the Working Sheet to facilitate the process of cleaning and transformation. Using the Find and Replace function in Microsoft Excel, gender codes were standardized, substituting 'M' with 'Male' and 'F' with 'Female'. Similarly, the same method was applied to marital status, replacing 'm' with 'married' and 's' with 'single' . This meticulous approach ensures consistency and clarity in the dataset.

The Age Bracket column underwent a comprehensive categorization process using a nested IF function. Specifically, individuals with an age greater than 55 were classified as 'Old.' For ages ranging from 31 to 55, the label 'Middle Age' was assigned. Meanwhile, individuals below the age of 31 were categorized as 'Adolescent.' This age categorization gives a clearer understanding of the age distribution within the analyzed population at a glance.

Customers that commute within 0 to 1 mile are the highest bike buyers with a distribution of 200. It is important to note the inverse relationship between the customer’s commute distance and bike purchase. The higher the commuting distance in miles, the lower the chances of customers purchasing a bike.

# RECOMMENDATION

•	The customer commute distance is a major factor for bike buyers. Hence, the management should focus on customers with a commuting distance of 0 to 1 mile.

•	Considering that the majority of bike buyers own 0 to 2 cars, it is strategically imperative to direct all marketing efforts towards this specific market segment. By tailoring efforts to address the preferences and needs of individuals within this car ownership range, we can effectively capture and engage a substantial portion of our target audience. This focused approach will ensure that marketing efforts resonates with those who are more likely to embrace biking as a preferred mode of transportation or recreational activity.

•	The middle age bracket of 31 to 55 years stands out as the major market for bike sales. In order to effectively capitalize on the opportunities presented by this dynamic market, it is crucial to enhance or develop marketing strategies in line with objectives that reinforces the current market foothold within the age bracket and smoothly guiding potential buyers into becoming actively engaged and committed customers.
